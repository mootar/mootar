### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### About myself:
I am in active search for an internship/job on a Junior Manual QA Engineer vacancy. I will consider vacancies with any employment pattern.
Since 2011, I have been working in design of steel structures for oil depots and oil storage facilities, in particular steel vertical and horizontal storage tanks.
